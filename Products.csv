Each IceBlades fan blade has a 3D-curved aerodynamic design, allowing the fan to achieve a better flow rate and lower noise. In addition, the IceBlades fans also use a fluid-dynamics bearing, which can achieve better vibration reduction and lower noise when compared to ordinary fans. Here, Integrated Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax (2x2)) wireless connectivity is also available. This laptop has 1 x COMBO audio jack, 1 x Type-C USB 3.2 (Gen 1), 1 x Type-A USB 3.2 (Gen 1), 2 x Type-A USB2.0, 1 x HDMI and 1 x micro SD card slots. The VivoBook 15 keeps you productive and entertained, no matter where you are. With an overall weight of just 1.7kg and an ultrathin profile, VivoBook 15 easily slips into your backpack so you can effortlessly take it along. The latest Asus VivoBook 15 S513EQ Laptop has 02 years International Limited Warranty (Battery 1 year)."

The Nitro 5 was one of the first notebooks to introduce the then newly announced Turing graphics cards from NVIDIA. Now, it is the processors that are upgraded, and with Comet Lake-H, the new Nitro 5 (AN515-55) will try to assault the budget gaming market. However, it has a frightening competitor in the face of the ASUS TUF A15 (FA506) and its crazy Intel Core i7-10750H Processor (12M Cache, 2.60 GHz up to 5.00 GHz). Thankfully, Acer is planning on AMD-equipped laptops from the Nitro family, as well, but until that happens, we are â€œstuckâ€� with what Intel has to offer. Despite all of the fuss about them, they proved to be a non-substantial upgrade over the Coffee Lake-HR CPUs, and they produce a lot of excessive heat. It is particularly interesting how the Nitro 5 (AN515-55) will counter this, especially when you consider the fact that its predecessor wasnâ€™t the best in terms of cooling. Nevertheless, there are a couple of important features making a return, like a 60Hz display and RAID 0 support â€“ something that is still rarely seen in the budget gaming laptop market."

The chassis has a matte silver finish, which Acer has contrasted with a black plastic display frame. Acer has used smooth surfaces throughout. There is no maintenance hatch though, so accessing the machine's internal components requires some disassembly. We shall discuss this in the Maintenance section of this review. The processing of our review unit does not give rise to any criticisms. Gaps between materials are precise, and nothing protrudes in any way. The device also does not reveal any serious stability problems. The base unit can be twisted a bit, but not concerningly so. The same applies to the lid. Applying pressure on the back of the lid does not cause the display to distort at all. The display is held in place by pleasingly tight hinges. These hold the lid firmly in place, with the display barely teetering as we use it. The hinges allow the display to be opened up to 180Â°, for reference. It is possible to open the lid with one hand, too. The laptop has two USB Type-A ports, with one operating at the USB 2.0 standard and the other on the newer USB 3.2 Gen1 standard. There is also a USB Type-C port that utilizes the latest USB 3.2 Gen2 standard. The latter supports both DisplayPort and USB Power Delivery (PD), meaning that the device can output audio and video while being charged. Acer has still included a full-sized HDMI port and a power connector though, giving the Swift 3 two charging and video outputs. The laptop does not have a memory card reader. Acer has equipped the Swift 3 with an Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200, a modem that not only supports the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, but also the newer ax standard. Additionally, the AX200 offers Bluetooth 5.0 functionality. Our table below represents optimal Wi-Fi conditions with no other Wi-Fi devices placed between our review unit and our router. We positioned the laptop and our router closely, too. Acer has also equipped the Swift 3 with a 720p webcam. The results are somewhat washed-out and lacking in color accuracy. With a Delta E deviation of just under 12, the Swift 3 misses our ideal target of 3 by a wide margin. "
